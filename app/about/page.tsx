          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-accent">The Modern Tech?</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            AI also known as Artificial intelligence, is the new and modern age of technology. AI is basically like a human brain outside of a human being. The essence of AI is getting everywhere and accept or not AI is becoming powerful day by day. And as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has famously said that AI is not going to take jobs the person using AI is going to take the jobs of others.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Ask any tech guy about how big of an impact AI is creating in this world and traditional way of doing businesses and his/her words might shock you. The thing is that the previous world as we know it is fully changing and the pace it's changing at is fast and any business can only survive it through fast and speedy adaptation to this change.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Whether it's any business or any job the person who is using AI will outperform the ones without it within the next few years. So, using AI is really important as it will give you the opportunity to adapt to the changes happening in this world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We can learn from history itself, let's take you to the Technical Computer revolution of the 90's the companies who adapted the new technology went far ahead and the ones who ignored it went bankrupt.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most people know AI just as a chatbot like Gemini, Chatgpt, Grok or Perplexity but AI has already become something far too big than that. Now, anyone can integrate AI for their daily workings the work which took humans hours to do now AI can do that in minutes, whether it is posting online, talking to new people, helping a customer with their purchase of the new product AI is now everywhere and it can do a lot of things which generally not a lot of people know about.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
            AI can help you automate your daily workings which were earlier done manually, which will afterall help you in saving a lot of money, human resources and time which you can spend with your family, in doing something much more creative or in thinking and planning about your business growth. All summarised AI can help you with the work which is currently being done by a human being. AI can help you automate that work which will let you save more money, more time and save more human efforts which if placed in the right spot will generate more sales and will grow your business even more!
